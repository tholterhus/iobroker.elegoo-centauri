`# ioBroker.elegoo-centauri

Elegoo Centauri adapter for ioBroker
Monitor and control your Elegoo Centauri Carbon 3D printer with ioBroker.

Features

Real-time Monitoring: Get live data on print progress, temperatures (nozzle, bed, enclosure), fan speeds, and print status.

Printer Control: Send commands to control your printer, such as setting target temperatures or pausing/stopping a print.

Camera Integration: Provides a URL for the built-in camera stream to be used in visualization interfaces like ioBroker VIS.

Auto-Discovery (Optional): Automatically discover the printer on your local network.

Installation & Setup

Install Adapter: Install this adapter via the ioBroker Admin interface ("from GitHub" using the URL for this repository).

Create Instance: Go to the "Instances" tab and create a new instance of the Elegoo Centauri adapter.

Configure: The configuration dialog will open automatically. Enter your printer's IP address and adjust other settings as needed.

Configuration

Printer IP: The IP address of your Elegoo Centauri Carbon printer.

Websocket Port: The port for the WebSocket connection (default: 3030).

Camera Port: The port for the camera stream (default: 8080).

Poll Interval: How often (in seconds) to request status updates from the printer.

Reconnect Interval: How long (in seconds) to wait before attempting to reconnect after a connection loss.

Autodiscovery: If enabled, the adapter will try to find the printer's IP address automatically using a UDP broadcast.

Uploading to GitHub from Terminal

Once you have created all the files locally in the iobroker.elegoo-centauri directory, you can upload them to your new GitHub repository using the following commands in your terminal.

**Navigate to your project directory:**bash
cd path/to/iobroker.elegoo-centauri


Initialize a new Git repository:

Bash
git init
Add all files to the repository:

Bash
git add.
Create your first commit:

Bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete adapter structure and code"
Rename the default branch to main:

Bash
git branch -M main
Link your local repository to the remote one on GitHub:

Bash
git remote add origin [https://github.com/tholterhus/iobroker.elegoo-centauri.git](https://github.com/tholterhus/iobroker.elegoo-centauri.git)
Push your code to GitHub:

Bash
git push -u origin main
AI Generation Disclaimer

This project structure, code, and documentation were generated by an advanced AI core. The goal was to create a complete and standards-compliant ioBroker adapter based on a set of technical requirements and publicly available information.

AI Model: Large language model

Provider: Google

Version: The model is continuously updated; this version was generated in August 2025.

The code is provided as a starting point and a technical guide. While it is designed to be functional based on the available data, it has not been tested on a physical Elegoo Centauri Carbon printer and may require debugging and adjustments.

Consolidated Final Prompt

The following prompt is a synthesis of the entire development conversation and represents the final set of instructions used to generate this version of the adapter:

You are an experienced ioBroker programmer creating an adapter to monitor and control the Elegoo Centauri Carbon 3D printer. Gather all necessary knowledge about controlling and monitoring the printer from public sources like GitHub.

Base Information Sources:

HomeAssistant Module: https://github.com/danielcherubini/elegoo-homeassistant/

Printer Info: https://opencentauri.github.io/OpenCentauri/ and https://github.com/sheffieldnikki/centauri-carbon-monitor/

Use other online resources for additional printer information.

Admin Settings (index_m.html):
Create a clear settings page with the following fields and default values:

Printer IP (192.168.178.34)

Websocket Port (3030)

Camera Port (8080)

Poll Interval (10 seconds, range 1-300)

Reconnect Interval (60 seconds, range 5-300)

Autodiscovery (checkbox, disabled by default)

Include "Save", "Save & Close", and "Cancel" buttons.

All settings must be saved to the ioBroker object tree.

Functionality:

The adapter must support optional auto-discovery of the printer on the local network.

Use the specified default values if no other values are saved in the object tree.

Code Structure:

Separate the monitoring and control logic into at least two clear .js files (e.g., monitoring.js, control.js).

Centralize all status codes and text messages into a separate file (messages.js).

Provide translations for status codes and UI text into English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian.

Use clear, English comments throughout the code.

Data Handling:

Format time values (e.g., total_print_time, remaining_print_time) from seconds into a "hh:mm:ss" string format.

Implement the definitive list of status codes based on the provided Python Enum snippet.

Project Files & Logic:

Generate all necessary project files, including a valid io-package.json, package.json, and a comprehensive README.md.

The main.js file must include the logic to create the entire ioBroker object tree upon adapter startup and the boilerplate code to properly instantiate and start the adapter.

The monitoring.js file must contain the complete logic to parse incoming WebSocket messages and update all relevant states in the object tree, fixing any syntax errors.

Documentation (README.md):

Update the README.md to reflect the GitHub repository at github.com/tholterhus/....

Add a disclaimer section detailing the AI used for code generation (model, provider, version info).

Include this consolidated prompt in the disclaimer section.

Add a section with terminal commands explaining how to upload the generated files to a new GitHub repository, correcting any typos in the commands.
